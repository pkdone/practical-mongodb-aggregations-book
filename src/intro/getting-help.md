# Getting Help

No one can hold the names and syntax of all the different aggregation stages and operators in their heads. I'd bet even _MongoDB Aggregations Royalty_ ([Asya Kamsky](http://www.kamsky.org/stupid-tricks-with-mongodb)) couldn't, although I'm sure she would give it a good go!

The good news is there is no need for you to try to remember all the stages & operators. The MongoDB online documentation provides you with a set of excellent _references_ here:

 * MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline [Stages reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/aggregation-stages/)
 * MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline [Operators reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/expressions/)

To help you get started with the purpose of each stage in the MongoDB Framework, consult the "cheatsheets" in the appendix of this book:

 * MongoDB Aggregation [Stages Cheatsheet](../appendices/cheatsheet.md)
 * MongoDB Aggregation [Stages Cheatsheet Source Code](../appendices/cheatsheet-source.md)
 
If you are getting stuck with an aggregation pipeline and want some help, an active online community will almost always have the answer. So pose your questions at either:

 * The [MongoDB Community Forums](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/)
 * Stack Overflow - [MongoDB Questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb)

You may be asking for just general advice. However, suppose you want to ask for help on a specific aggregation pipeline under development. In that case, you should provide a sample input document, a copy of your current pipeline code (in its JSON syntax format and not a programming language specific format) and an example of the output that you are trying to achieve. If you provide this extra information, you will have a far greater chance of receiving a timely and optimal response.
