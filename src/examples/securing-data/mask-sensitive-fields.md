# Mask Sensitive Fields

__Minimum MongoDB Version:__ 4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; _(due to use of [`$rand`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/rand/) operator)_


## Scenario

You want to perform irreversible masking on the sensitive fields of a collection of _credit card payments_, ready to provide the output data set to a 3rd party for analysis, without exposing sensitive information to the 3rd party. The specific changes that you need to make to the payments' fields are:
 * Partially obfuscate the card holder's name
 * Obfuscate the first 12 digits of the card's number, retaining only the final 4 digits
 * Adjust the card's expiry date-time by adding or subtracting a random amount up to a maximum of 30 days (~1 month)
 * Replace the card's 3 digit security code with a random set of 3 digits
 * Adjust the transaction's amount by adding or subtracting a random amount up to a maximum of 10% of the original amount
 * Change the `reported` field's boolean value to the opposite value for roughly 20% of the records
 * If the embedded `customer_info` sub-document's `category` field is set to _RESTRICTED_, exclude the whole `customer_info` sub-document


## Sample Data Population

Drop any old version of the database (if it exists) and then populate a new `payments` collection with 2 credit card payment documents, containing sensitive data:

```javascript
db = db.getSiblingDB("book-mask-sensitive-fields");
db.dropDatabase();

// Insert records into the payments collection
db.payments.insertMany([
  {
    "card_name": "Mrs. Jane A. Doe",
    "card_num": "1234567890123456",
    "card_expiry": ISODate("2023-08-31T23:59:59Z"),
    "card_sec_code": "123",
    "card_type": "CREDIT",        
    "transaction_id": "eb1bd77836e8713656d9bf2debba8900",
    "transaction_date": ISODate("2021-01-13T09:32:07Z"),
    "transaction_amount": NumberDecimal("501.98"),
    "reported": false,
    "customer_info": {
      "category": "RESTRICTED",
      "rating": 89,
      "risk": 3,
    },
  },
  {
    "card_name": "Jim Smith",
    "card_num": "9876543210987654",
    "card_expiry": ISODate("2022-12-31T23:59:59Z"),
    "card_sec_code": "987",
    "card_type": "DEBIT",        
    "transaction_id": "634c416a6fbcf060bb0ba90c4ad94f60",
    "transaction_date": ISODate("2020-11-24T19:25:57Z"),
    "transaction_amount": NumberDecimal("64.01"),
    "reported": true,
    "customer_info": {
      "category": "NORMAL",
      "rating": 78,
      "risk": 55,
    },
  },
]);
```


## Aggregation Pipeline

Define a pipeline ready to perform the aggregation:

```javascript
var pipeline = [
  // Replace a subset of fields with new values
  {"$set": {
    // Extract the last word from the name , eg: 'Doe' from 'Mrs. Jane A. Doe'
    "card_name": {"$regexFind": {"input": "$card_name", "regex": /(\S+)$/}},
          
    // Mask card num 1st part retaining last 4 chars, eg: '1234567890123456' -> 'XXXXXXXXXXXX3456'
    "card_num": {"$concat": [
                  "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
                  {"$substrCP": ["$card_num", 12, 4]},
                ]},                     

    // Add/subtract a random time amount of a maximum of 30 days (~1 month) each-way
    "card_expiry": {"$add": [
                     "$card_expiry",
                     {"$floor": {"$multiply": [{"$subtract": [{"$rand": {}}, 0.5]}, 2*30*24*60*60*1000]}},
                   ]},                     

    // Replace each digit with random digit, eg: '133' -> '472'
    "card_sec_code": {"$concat": [
                       {"$toString": {"$floor": {"$multiply": [{"$rand": {}}, 10]}}},
                       {"$toString": {"$floor": {"$multiply": [{"$rand": {}}, 10]}}},
                       {"$toString": {"$floor": {"$multiply": [{"$rand": {}}, 10]}}},
                     ]},
                     
    // Add/subtract a random percent of the amount's value up to 10% maximum each-way
    "transaction_amount": {"$add": [
                            "$transaction_amount",
                            {"$multiply": [{"$subtract": [{"$rand": {}}, 0.5]}, 0.2, "$transaction_amount"]},
                          ]},
                          
    // Retain field's bool value 80% of time on average, setting to the opposite value 20% of time
    "reported": {"$cond": {
                   "if":   {"$lte": [{"$rand": {}}, 0.8]},
                   "then": "$reported",
                   "else": {"$not": ["$reported"]},
                }},      

    // Exclude sub-doc if the sub-doc's category field's value is 'RESTRICTED'
    "customer_info": {"$cond": {
                        "if":   {"$eq": ["$customer_info.category", "RESTRICTED"]}, 
                        "then": "$$REMOVE",     
                        "else": "$customer_info",
                     }},                                         
                
    // Mark _id field to excluded from results
    "_id": "$$REMOVE",                
  }},
  
  // Take regex matched last word from the card name and prefix it with hardcoded value
  {"$set": {
    "card_name": {"$concat": ["Mx. Xxx ", {"$ifNull": ["$card_name.match", "Anonymous"]}]},                       
  }},
];
```


## Execution

Execute the aggregation using the defined pipeline and also view its explain plan:

```javascript
db.payments.aggregate(pipeline);
```

```javascript
db.payments.explain("executionStats").aggregate(pipeline);
```


## Expected Results

Two documents should be returned, corresponding to the original two source documents, but this time with many of their fields redacted and obfuscated, plus the `customer_info` embedded document omitted for one record due to it having been marked as `RESTRICTED`, as shown below:

```javascript
[
  {
    card_name: 'Mx. Xxx Doe',
    card_num: 'XXXXXXXXXXXX3456',
    card_expiry: ISODate('2023-08-31T23:29:46.460Z'),
    card_sec_code: '295',
    card_type: 'CREDIT',
    transaction_id: 'eb1bd77836e8713656d9bf2debba8900',
    transaction_date: ISODate('2021-01-13T09:32:07.000Z'),
    transaction_amount: NumberDecimal('492.4016988351474881660000000000000'),
    reported: false
  },
  {
    card_name: 'Mx. Xxx Smith',
    card_num: 'XXXXXXXXXXXX7654',
    card_expiry: ISODate('2023-01-01T00:34:49.330Z'),
    card_sec_code: '437',
    card_type: 'DEBIT',
    transaction_id: '634c416a6fbcf060bb0ba90c4ad94f60',
    transaction_date: ISODate('2020-11-24T19:25:57.000Z'),
    transaction_amount: NumberDecimal('58.36081337486762223600000000000000'),
    reported: false,
    customer_info: { category: 'NORMAL', rating: 78, risk: 55 }
  }
]
```


## Observations

 * __Targeted Redaction.__ The pipeline uses a `$cond` operator to return the `$$REMOVE` marker variable if the `category` field is equal to `RESTRICTED`. This informs the aggregation engine to exclude the whole `customer_info` sub-document from the stage's output for the record. Alternatively, the pipeline could have used a `$redact` stage to achieve the same. However, `$redact` typically has to perform more processing work due to needing to check every field in the document. Hence, if a pipeline is only to redact out one specific sub-document, use the approach outlined in this example.
 
 * __Regular Expression.__ For masking the `card_name` field, a regular expression operator is used to extract the last word of the field's original value. `$regexFind` returns metadata into the stage's output records, indicating if the match succeeded and what the matched value is. Therefore, an additional `$set` stage is required later in the pipeline to extract the actual matched word from this metadata and prefix it with some hard-coded text. MongoDB version 5.0 introduced a new [`$getField`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/getField/) operator, which you can instead use to directly extract the "regex" result field (`match`). Consequently, if you are using MongoDB 5.0 or greater, you can eliminate the second `$set` stage from the end of your pipeline and then replace the line of code which sets the masked value of the `card_name` field to the following: 

     ```javascript
     // Prefix with a hard-coded value followed by the regex extracted last word of the card name
     "card_name": {"$concat": ["Mx. Xxx ", {"$ifNull": [{"$getField": {"field": "match", "input": {"$regexFind": {"input": "$card_name", "regex": /(\S+)$/}}}}, "Anonymous"]}]},
     ```
  
 * __Meaningful Insight.__ Even though the pipeline is irreversibly obfuscating fields, it doesn't mean that the masked data is useless for performing analytics to gain insight. The pipeline masks some fields by fluctuating the original values by a small but limited random percentage (e.g. `card_expiry`, `transaction_amount`), rather than replacing them with completely random values (e.g. `card_sec_code`). In such cases, if the input data set is sufficiently large, then minor variances will be equalled out. For the fields that are only varied slightly, users can derive similar trends and patterns from analysing the masked data as they would the original data.
